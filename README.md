# ðŸŽµ Understanding Musical Trends: EDA on Spotifyâ€™s Most Streamed Songs of 2023

## Foreword

This project's objective is to examine song streaming trends on Spotify, a music platform, in 2023.

We initially examine the variables in the dataset to see if any are missing and what data types are being used before beginning the real analysis. Many important factors are highlighted, such as the total number of streams, the date of the song's release, and musical elements including danceability, beats per minute (BPM), and structure. 
Bar graphs and scatter plots, which reveal patterns and trends in time-series data, are other ways that data trends are displayed.

This section's questions aimed to investigate the connections between the streams and other musical elements like tempo and energy. 
Along with information on the factors that contributed to the song tracks' popularity, the report offers suggestions for recording artists, stakeholders, and other significant players in the music business. 

Therefore, the goal of this EDA is to shed light on the elements that contributed to Spotify streaming success in 2023.
