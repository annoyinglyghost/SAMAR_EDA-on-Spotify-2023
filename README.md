# ðŸŽµ Understanding Musical Trends: EDA on Spotifyâ€™s Most Streamed Songs of 2023

## Foreword

This project's objective is to examine song streaming trends on Spotify, a music platform, in 2023.

We initially examine the variables in the dataset to see if any are missing and what data types are being used before beginning the real analysis. Many important factors are highlighted, such as the total number of streams, the date of the song's release, and musical elements including danceability, beats per minute (BPM), and structure. 
Bar graphs and scatter plots, which reveal patterns and trends in time-series data, are other ways that data trends are displayed.

This section's questions aimed to investigate the connections between the streams and other musical elements like tempo and energy. 
Along with information on the factors that contributed to the song tracks' popularity, the report offers suggestions for recording artists, stakeholders, and other significant players in the music business. 

Therefore, the goal of this EDA is to shed light on the elements that contributed to Spotify streaming success in 2023.

> [!Note]

## Loading the Dataset
- Before doing the analysis and interpretation of data, import first the libraries that will be used which are pandas, matplot, and seaborn.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

- After that is done load the data set using `pd.read_csv()`

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# reading the csv, loading the dataset
spotify = 'spotify-2023.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(spotify, encoding='ISO-8859-1')
# printing the dataset
df
```

> [!Tip]
> `encoding='ISO-8859-1'` was used because ISO-8859[^2] is a family of single-byte encoding schemes used to represent alphabets that can be represented within the range of 127 to 255. These various alphabets are defined as "parts" in the format ISO-8859-n, the most familiar of these likely being ISO-8859-1 aka 'Latin-1'.

**Further Explanation:**

When loading a csv file there are some accented characters, special symbols, etc. that may cause an error when reading the the dataset. In this case when the file contains noN-UTF-8 characters the `ISO 8859-1` encoding is used.

## Overview of Dataset
How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?
To find the row and column of the dataset use the code `.shape`

ðŸŒ± Input:

```python
#get the size of the dataset
shape = df.shape
print(f"The dataset has {shape[0]} rows and {shape[1]} columns.")
```

ðŸŒ³Output:

The dataset has 953 rows and 24 columns.

> [!Tip]
> Upon using the `.shape` code, it will automatically get the rows and columns, and using the print function will show the results of the said code. The `.shape` returns a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements[^3].

<br>

What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?

ðŸŒ± Input:
``` python
# getting the summary of the dataset
df.info()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

RangeIndex: 953 entries, 0 to 952

Data columns (total 24 columns):

| # | Column | Non-Null Count |  Dtype |

**Explanation:**
To explain the results above, there are a total of 24 columns that are related to the music tracks. Each column represents something in the given dataset. Although in_shazam_charts has 903 non-null entry and key has 858 non-null entries which means that both of these columns contains missing data/entries, most of it contains 953 non-null entries which means that those columns have complete data for all entries. There are also 7 object columns which hold textual information and 17 integer columns which holds numerical data.

## Basic Descriptive Statistics
- Before getting the mean, median, and standard deviation, use the code `.describe()` first to get the summary of the statistics for each numeric column in the dataset.

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# to get the summary of numerical values in the dataset
df.describe().round(4)
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:

What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?
- To find the mean, median, and standard deviation, we can use the code `.mean()` for the mean, `.median()` for the median, and `.std()` for the standard deviation.
  
ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# converts the values in the strems columns to number and replaces the non-numbers to NaN 
df['streams'] = pd.to_numeric(df['streams'], errors='coerce')
#removes the Nan values
df = df.dropna(subset=['streams'])
# calculates the mean
df['streams'].mean()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:

514137424.93907565

<br>

ðŸŒ± Input:
``` python
# calculates the median
df['streams'].median()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:

290530915.0

<br>
  
ðŸŒ± Input:
``` python
# calculates the standard deviation
df['streams'].std()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:

566856949.0388832

What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?
- We can graph whether there are noticeable trends or outliers in the distribution of released_year and artist_count. Using matplotlib, a graph can be generated to help notice these trends.

ðŸŒ± Input:
``` python
# Set the size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))

# Plotting the distribution of the released_year
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)  # 1 row, 2 columns, 1st plot
plt.hist(df['released_year'],  color='red', edgecolor='white')  # Histogram
plt.title('The Distribution of Released Year')  # Title for the plot
plt.xlabel('Year')  # X-axis label
plt.ylabel('Frequency')  # Y-axis label

# Plotting the distribution of the artist_count
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)  # 1 row, 2 columns, 2nd plot
plt.hist(df['artist_count'],  color='pink', edgecolor='white')  # Histogram
plt.title('The Distribution of Artist Count')  # Title for the plot
plt.xlabel('Number of Artists')  # X-axis label
plt.ylabel('Frequency')  # Y-axis label

# Display the plots
plt.show()
```

**Answer**

As shown in the graphs above, most tracks were released around 2020. This could be because Spotify and other streaming platforms have become more well-known recently. Also, plenty of tracks were released in this time because more and more artists are making music. Single artists create most of the tracks, and a few artists collaborate to make music.

>[!Note]
>The codes `.value_counts()` and `.sort_index()` count and arrange the counts in order. `plt.figure()` will help in creating the figure of the graph. The `.subplot()` helps in creating the plots side by side, `plt.title()` is used to give the plots titles, and `tracks_per_year/month(kind='bar')` plots the two columns' data as a bar chart to show the tracks released per year and month. Lastly, `plt.show()` shows the bar graph.
---

## Top Performers
Which track has the highest number of streams? Display the top 5 most streamed tracks.
- To find the highest number of streams `.nlargest()` finds the rows with the highest value in the specified column. The `.reser_index()` resets the index from 0 up to desired number rows. 

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
#getting the 5 most streamed tracks
df.nlargest(5, 'streams')[['track_name', 'streams']].reset_index()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:

| | index | track_name | streams |
| ----- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0 | 55 | Blinding Lights | 3.703895e+09 |
| 1 | 179 | Shape of You | 3.703895e+09 |
| 2 | 86 | Someone You Loved | 2.887242e+09 |
| 3 | 620 | Dance Monkey | 2.864792e+09 |
| 4 | 41 | Sunflower - Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse | 2.808097e+09 |

**Answer**

The results show that the most streamed track in 2023 is Blinding Lights.

<br>

Who are the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks in the dataset?
- Just like from above, the code `.value_counts()`, `.nlargest()` and, `.reset_index()` was used to get the top 5 most frequent artists based on the number of tracks.

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Get the top 5 artists
df['artist(s)_name'].value_counts().nlargest(5).reset_index()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:
| | artists(s)_name | count |
|------|---------|------|
| 0 | Taylor Swift | 34 |
| 1 | The Weekend | 22 |
| 2 | Bad Bunny | 19 |
| 3 | SZA | 19 |
| 4 | Harry Styles | 17 |

**Answer**

The results show that the top artist in 2023 based on the number of tracks is Taylor Swift ðŸŒŸ

Analyze the trends in the number of tracks released over time. Plot the number of tracks released per year. 
- To analyze the trend, graphs will be used again to see the results in the number of tracks released over time. The matplotlib is used again to effectively show these trends.

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Count and dort the number of tracks in each year
tyear = df['released_year'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Set the size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))

# plot for tracks that are released per year
plt.plot(1, 2, 1)
tyear.plot(kind='bar', color='pink')
plt.title('Tracks Released Per Year')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

**Answer**

As shown on the graph, back in the 1900's there are only a small amount of tracks that are released. Then on the year 2010 and above, it is seen that the number of tracks released are ascending with the year 2022 being the highest year with tracks released.

<br>

Does the number of tracks released per month follow any noticeable patterns? Which month sees the most releases?
- To find the number of tracks released per month a graph is again to be created.

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Count and dort the number of tracks in each month
tyear = df['released_month'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Set the size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5))

# plot for tracks that are released per month
plt.plot(1, 2, 1)
tyear.plot(kind='bar', color='pink')
plt.title('Tracks Released Per Month')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:
![image](https://github.com/annoyinglyghost/Images-2-/blob/main/ttrends2.png)

**Answer**

The graph shows that the month that has the most releases is January and May and the least releases per month is August. There are no noticeable patterns on the tracks released per month

## Genre and Music Characteristics
Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
- A scatter plot is one of the ways to find the correlation between the three. By using `plt.scatter()`, a plot can be generated to show the given correlation. The other codes are also used just like the ones from before.

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Set the size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 6))

# Create the scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['bpm'], df['streams'], color='red')
plt.scatter(df['danceability_%'], df['streams'], color='pink')
plt.scatter(df['energy_%'], df['streams'], color='purple')
plt.title('BPM vs Danceability (%)')

# Show the results
plt.legend(['bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%'  ])
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:
![image](https://github.com/annoyinglyghost/Images-2-/blob/main/splot1.png)

**Answer**

As seen from the scatter plot above, danceability and energy show the most correlation between all of them, and they influence streams the most.

<br>

Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Set the size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 6))

# Create the scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['danceability_%'], df['streams'], color='blue')
plt.scatter(df['energy_%'], df['streams'], color='green')
plt.title('Danceability and Energy')

# Show the results
plt.legend(['danceability_%', 'energy_%'  ], bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1), loc=1, borderaxespad=0)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:
![image](https://github.com/annoyinglyghost/Images-2-/blob/main/splot2.png)

**Answer**

Shown above is the scatter plot between danceability and energy, and it is seen that the plots are all scattered, which means that there is no correlation between the two.

<br>

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Set the size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 6))

# Create the scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['valence_%'], df['streams'], color='orange')
plt.scatter(df['acousticness_%'], df['streams'], color='black')
plt.title('Valence and Acousticness')

# Show the results
plt.legend(['valence_%', 'acousticness_%'  ], bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1), loc=1, borderaxespad=0)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:
![image](https://github.com/annoyinglyghost/Images-2-/blob/main/splot3.png)

**Answer**

Just like from the scatter plot before, it is seen that the plots are scattered, which signifies that no correlation is between valence and acousticness.

>[!Tip]
>With Pyplot, you can use the scatter() function to draw a scatter plot.[^6] The scatter() function plots one dot for each observation. It needs two arrays of the same length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for values on the y-axis

## Platform Popularity
How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, spotify_charts, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?
- To compare the three platforms, creating a graph to show the results will be best. Just like the ones above, a bar graph is one of the graphs you can do to show the outcome. 

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
#  Convert columns to numeric
df.loc[:, 'in_spotify_playlists'] = pd.to_numeric(df['in_spotify_playlists'], errors='coerce')
df.loc[:, 'in_deezer_playlists'] = pd.to_numeric(df['in_deezer_playlists'], errors='coerce')
df.loc[:, 'in_apple_playlists'] = pd.to_numeric(df['in_apple_playlists'], errors='coerce')

# Sum the number of playlists 
spotify_sum = df['in_spotify_playlists'].sum()
deezer_sum = df['in_deezer_playlists'].sum()
apple_sum = df['in_apple_playlists'].sum()

# Create a Series to hold the counts
playlist_counts = pd.Series([spotify_sum, deezer_sum, apple_sum], index=['Spotify', 'Deezer', 'Apple'])

# Plot the data
playlist_counts.plot(kind='bar', color='pink')
plt.title('Number of Tracks in Playlists')
plt.xlabel('Platform')
plt.ylabel('Total Playlist Count')
plt.show()
```

ðŸŒ³ Output:
![Image](https://github.com/annoyinglyghost/Images-2-/blob/main/platform.png)

**Answer**
The three playlists were first converted to numerical data to get the number to compare the three platforms. As shown in the figure above, Spotify is, without a doubt, the platform that favors the most popular tracks.

## Advanced Analysis
Based on the streams data, can you identify any patterns among tracks with the same key or mode (Major vs. Minor)?
- 

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Calculate the average streams 
avg_streams_by_key = df.groupby('key')['streams'].mean()
avg_streams_by_mode = df.groupby('mode')['streams'].mean()

# Setting the size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))

# Bar plot for average streams by Key
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
avg_streams_by_key.plot(kind='bar', color='pink')
plt.title('Average Streams by Key')
plt.xlabel('Key')
plt.ylabel('Average Streams')

# Bar plot for average streams by Mode (Major vs Minor)
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
avg_streams_by_mode.plot(kind='bar', color='red')
plt.title('Average Streams by Mode (Major vs Minor)')
plt.xlabel('Mode (0 = Minor, 1 = Major)')
plt.ylabel('Average Streams')

# Display the results
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Do certain genres or artists consistently appear in more playlists or charts? Perform an analysis to compare the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts.

ðŸŒ± Input:
```python
# Sample data setup
artist_playlist_counts = df.groupby('artist(s)_name')[['in_spotify_playlists', 'in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists']].sum()
artist_playlist_counts['total_appearances'] = artist_playlist_counts.sum(axis=1)

# Get the top 10 artists
top_artists = artist_playlist_counts.sort_values('total_appearances', ascending=False).head(10)

# Displaying the result 
top_artists.reset_index()
```
